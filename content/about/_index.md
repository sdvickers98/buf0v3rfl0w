I attended the University of Georgia and got bachelors degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics. I've been working in the information security industry since 2021 as an application penetration tester. This blog is mainly part of an attempt to become more involved in the infosec community, as well as give my random musings on various topics related to infosec.

As of the time I'm writing this (December 2023), I'm expecting to be a father by the end of the month, and I want to do everything I possibly can to have a successful career in this field and provide for my family.

In my free time, I like spending time with my wife, bingeing TV shows and movies, playing videogames, reading, and playing piano.

Thanks for checking out the blog,

Dakota Vickers
