I attended the University of Georgia (UGA) and got bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics. I've been working in the information security industry since 2021 as an application penetration tester. This blog is mainly part of an attempt to become more involved in the infosec community, as well as give my random musings on various topics related to infosec.

My journey into cybersecurity is one of happy accidents. While studying Mathematics at UGA, I was required to take elective courses in a math-related subject. There were a few options available, but I chose Computer Science, as I had always loved computer games and was interested in how programming worked. As you can probably guess, I ended up loving this subject, and I went on to declare a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. Later on during college, my roommate introduced me to the TV show "Mr. Robot", and from then on I was hooked on hacking.

I had finally found what I was meant to do, and I'm confident that I'll work in cybersecurity for the rest of my life. Over the years, my passion for this industry has only grown. I spend a lot of time outside of work trying to learn new hacking techniques and improve my skills every day. 

As of the time I'm writing this (December 2023), I'm expecting to be a father by the end of the month, and I want to do everything I possibly can to have a successful career in this field and provide for my family.

In my free time, I like spending time with my wife, bingeing TV shows and movies, playing videogames, reading, and playing piano. I'm also a huge UGA sports fan, Go Dawgs!

Thanks for checking out the blog,
